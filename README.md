# Mosaic API Examples

example apps built with the mosaic api ([docs.usemosaic.ai](https://docs.usemosaic.ai))

## [gdrive-trigger](https://github.com/mosaic-ai-labs/api-examples/tree/main/gdrive-trigger)

A compact, dependency-light script that watches a single Google Drive folder and pipes every new video through a Mosaic **Agent**.

## [dropbox-trigger](https://github.com/mosaic-ai-labs/api-examples/tree/main/dropbox-trigger)

A script that watches a Dropbox folder, runs a Mosaic Agent on new videos and posts results back to the same folder.

## [mosaic-mcp](https://github.com/mosaic-ai-labs/api-examples/tree/main/mosaic-mcp)

A lightweight [FastMCP](https://gofastmcp.com) wrapper around the Mosaic video-editing API.
It exposes convenient tools so LLMs (Claude, Cursor etc.) can upload
videos, run Mosaic agents, poll status, download outputs, and discover the
available agents â€“ all without hard-coding HTTP details in the prompt.
Includes uploading local files, listing and running agents, polling agent
status, and downloading outputs!

Try it out by adding the following to your Claude Desktop config:

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mosaic-api": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "mcp-remote",
        "http://mcp.usemosaic.ai/mcp"
      ],
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer mk_..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```
